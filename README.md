# Julia Rocket Lab

As part of a university project, the goal of this application was to create a website where users can quickly and humorously generate rockets. I aimed to make it fun to tweak the values and explore different designs. This site demonstrates that creating rockets isn’t rocket science; in fact, it’s child’s play. But the real question is: on wich mission would your rocket go?


# Functions

**Overview**
- Dynamic SVG with values that change based on user input
- User input-based image, text, and name generation
- Local storage where the user can find their rockets
- Different types of user inputs


**Inputs**

To achieve this goal, the first page allows users to set values such as weight, length, payload height, and number of boosters. A preview illustration dynamically adjusts to show how the rocket might look, using SVGs that update according to the input fields.

**Generating a pictiure**

To truly visualize your rocket, I integrated ChatGPT as an API in three distinct ways: to generate a custom name, a mission, and an image. In my opinion this makes the experience more fun to use by providing a personalized representation of your rocket.


**Local storage**

Once you've generated your amazing rocket, you won't want to lose it. That's why I've added local storage, allowing your rocket's data to be saved in the browser's local storage. This ensures your creation is always accessible.
